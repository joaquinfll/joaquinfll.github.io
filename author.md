Hi, I'm Joaquin.

For most of my career, I have worked as a system administrator in environments where there was a clear segregation between developers and sysops.
In 2017 I had the chance to join an organization beginning a cloud-native transformation journey. There, I started with agile practices and worked more closely with
the developers, applying DevSecOps principles and helping on shaping their OpenShift platform through the use of best practices for automation, cluster deployment, application onboarding, security, and resiliency.
